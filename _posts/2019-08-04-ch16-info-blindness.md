We have all noted that that little button on social media platforms asking us to share our location (Geo-tag). What does that button mean to crisis mapper? Simply put it means that your location at the time of a tweet post can be mapped AUTOMATICALLY. No digging needed.  About according to Meier about 3% of the Twitter population chooses to “share” their location when tweeting. Remember that a Tweet is just like an SMS message on a cell phone. Moreover we see that geo-tagged tweets, correlate to the presence of electricity. Other platforms then Twitter are also discussed such as Whatsapp and Google+ all with the same concepts. In 2013 there were more mobile phone users in the world then there where people… so I imagine by now that number has tripled. 

How much data is really exchanged through SMS? In early 2012 Filipinos send an average of 2 billion text messages every day. This breaks into 92% of the population in the Philippines. During Hurricane Sandy more than a million Instagram pictures and over 20 million tweets were posted within a 5 day period. So how do you find the needle in all the data? Heat Maps! By identifying the social media use through SMS you are latently identifying where the electricity in areas is and therefore can make more than a few impacts.  

A few take a ways:
    •	Information is just as important as food, water and shelter in today’s changing world. 
    •	Big Data is extremely useful in a Disaster situation as it comes in many formats, which boil down usually to SMS. 
    •	Disaster communities are also Digital communities.
