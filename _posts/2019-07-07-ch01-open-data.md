## Topic Overview
 Data is everywhere around us. Data is collected through so many ways and can answer so many questions, but the biggest question is what questions need to be answered. A commonality that I am seeing is that data provides and insight into topics that otherwise have no way of understanding measurement. There are problems, and people have ideas about possible solutions but only until they look at the math can they truly make predicitons. In the material that is covered so far I am seeing that there is not limit to the magmintude of projects that can be tackled with the appropriate amount of infomration. All over the US we rely on oranizations such as the farmers almanac and the National Weather serice for weather predications, and in many cases those organizations save lives! The overview for starting this class tells me one thing, and that is the big pools of data arent isn't a window into American life, but it is the only way for us truly understand the world we live in.

Lets talk about DJ Patil and some of the history that the US Government has had with open data. Back in 1996 Dj began to hack the Department of Commerce servers while he was attending University of Maryland just to see what kind of data he could find and what he could do with it, fast foward to 2014 and he was asked to 2014 as President Obama asks him to the White House to Be their "Data Scientist". DJ had a very strong background and understanding of the power of data and what that could mean for finding better uses for the data collected from the US Government.
The US Department of Commerce (aka Department of Science and Technology) is much more than its name, it collects and makes sense of all of the countrys economic statistics which are instramental in understanding our cultural and creating a decision based science that are windows into American life. The data that the US Department of COmmerce has collected is years of stastical information from every area, and just one of those areas is weather. That data collected from billions of dollars of devices and research is where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, National Census and many other oranganizations both private and public get its information from and how they store / share information. Many people have used the data from the government for uses such as starting private businesses in helping farming, creating private weather reporting organizations such as AccuWeather and using them to see patterns within our own government so that we can become more efficient in our programs and how the government operates overall. Transparency of our data has been protected for a long time but our President and who is in charge of the individual departments monitor what is released to the public. As President Trump took office the transparency of governmnet data started to disappear as many of the reports that citizens used to be able to view either had much less information to them or they completely disappeared. That is where the story of our countrys first chief data scientist and all of what data can offer starts to come to an end.

### Reality Mining: Census, Mobile Phones, and Internet Giants
Access to data in many formats is available publicly. Some examples of this data are the Census and the World Bank's International Survey. Google uses World Bank data to integrate simple visualization into its search results. Other sources may include Call Data records or CDRs, which are kept more closely to the chest of the cell phone service providers. This information can be used to identify time and general location of where a call or text was made by the recipient. Models of human movement & social networks can be developed from the CDR data and had become increasingly popular for researchers.In the Chapter it is noted that the gender, birthdate and Zip Code coupled with Census information can result in an individual being uniquely identified 63-87% of the time in data collection. AT&T is developing a group called WHERE (Work and Home Extracted Regions). This group is responsible for maintaining the privacy of AT&Ts clients. The group creates synthetic CDRs and notes that “The main benefit of these synthetic CDRs is that they maintain the privacy of individuals because no data from real individuals are used” (Eagle, N., & Greene, K.2014). 

Google and Facebook utilize their data for an advertising network. 
“Both companies also provide general statistics such as the number of emails or profiles your ad appears in. It’s this information that can be mined to determine overall sentiment toward a product across demographics…Facebook also offers an API that allows programmers to build applications that plug into Facebook users’ profiles.21 From these applications, a programmer can get access to as much information as a Facebook customer allows in his or her privacy settings, including phone numbers, contact lists, status updates, and any other identifying information” (Eagle, N., & Greene, K.2014).

Twitter’s data is largely represented on a public scale. They offer an API for researchers to tap into called “Twitter Fire Hose”. This however presents many issues as tweets are often fragmented with hashtags and alike. Given that all this data availble, it is important to forcus on how it can be best utilized. Many keepers of the CDRs are begining to realize that information can be used effectively in large scale circumstances.

## Key Take-Aways:


### Discussion Questions
1. Given that all the information on the GPS phones was utilized to locate those that sending out tweets, and all the research and work was conducted on personal laptops, what happens to all the data once the incident response is over? How is all this data managed today and utilized from the haiti response?
2. Does the timeframe of an organization or individual to stand-up this a system to track disaster information have the same significance as just trying to track data from another source… like the NOAA?
3. What is the most effective way to mine data so that it is quickly actionable for those that need it?
