### Citizen Surveillance 
New surveillance technology capable of capturing an area the size of a small city, for several hours at a time (Timberg, 2014) is quickly being developed, however, with it come mixed opinions on the benefits and concerns.  Those in favor of this type of surveillance include Ross McNutt, a retired Air Force officer and genial president of Persistent Surveillance Systems. Ross believes that surveillance cameras can help solve crimes that are committed, while also helping reduce crime altogether.  A reduction in crime would have positive side effects such as increased property values; as well as lower incarceration rates as the cameras would deter potential crimes.  He states that “cameras mounted on fixed-wing aircraft can provide far more useful intelligence than police helicopters do, for less money.” 
Those opposed to this type of surveillance are concerned with privacy and personal liberty. The imagery provided from these cameras has limitations.  People appear as single pixels making a clear picture of a person’s face impossible to see. Images would aid in tracking movement instead.  
In recognition of the concerns, McNutt consulted with the American Civil Liberties Union when writing the privacy policy for his company.  Policy includes rules on data retention length, image when and whom can view images, as well language limiting police use occurring only after a crime has been reported (Timberg, 2014). Many police departments are in favor of using cameras to help offset the reduction of personnel.  Advances to the technology would increase the range the cameras can capture, not the precision of the image captured.
