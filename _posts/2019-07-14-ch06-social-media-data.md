## Topic Overview




## Chapter Summaries



### Crowd Computing Social Media (Meier CH3)


### Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (Meier CH5)
Meier opens the chapter with the birth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 1962, which indeed was a game of chess that IBM used algorisms and programing to eventually beat several world renowned chess players. That chess game evolved overtime to become Watson (2011) as a search tool that is used today (2018/19) by nurses treating patients with Cancer. 

The next significant movement in Artificial Intelligence was utilized by Taha of Syriah to start a Crisis Map of the Syrian protest in 2011. This map (SyriahTracker) is still operational today and is considered the most up to date map of deaths and injuries. It is utilized by the Syrian Government, the World Health Organization, and local public health researchers. The Map began as a resource, identifying key words in news, articles, and press that related to symptoms of death and injury the groups were initially interested in. Today SyriahTracker, uses the same tactics, however has expanded to social media and other platforms to obtain its information. This map was the first to adapt techniques of data mining and advanced computing. 

Another innovation occurred with the American Red Cross in May 2013 out of the Oklahoma Digital Operations Center (3 staff Members). This was the ability to locate, and track individuals interested in volunteering to assist in the Tornado that took out 17 miles of a single town in 20 minutes. A training system was developed, and then to piggy back a system that utilized tweets with key words such as “donation” “need cloths” to identify specific needs within the community. This algorithem was developed “#Oklahoma.” The combination of letters s-h-e-l-t-e-r here would be coded as “Word Shelter = Yes” since shelter is indeed a word rather than a num- ber or punctuation mark. So Y would be the first “bar” in our barcode. Given that the word shelter appears only once in the tweet, “Frequency Shelter = 1”. And since shelter appears as the fifth word in that tweet: “Position Shelter = 5”.” (Meier, 2018). Today the American Red Cross still uses this information to identify areas in which shelters are needed the most in Disaster torn areas. 




## Key Take-Aways (for Yellowdig)
1. Artifical Intelligence has changed the face of disaster response, one crisis that has spawned from the big data is the filtration of it. In order to come up with viable information a significant amount of time must be spent on the front end or a disaster to map and identify key terms. With non-profits having limited funds and staff there are issues with consistency and burnout. 

### Discussion Questions
1. How does an Organization such as the American Red Cross take data from a 3 person office and utilize it in every office around the country? Some states like Arizona have 3 Red Cross Chapters and 17 offices with staff. 
2. Once a need such as Donations, and specific ones at that is recognized from this data is identified how does it get released into the public?
