## Data on Teams Overview (Randy Wilkins)

If you are one to embrace social groups, then these chapters, both about Big Data and Social Groups may alter your view about learning and how you interact within those groups. Because the masses have left untold amounts of “breadcrumbs” behind from their use of smartphones, the Internet, personal GPS systems and other devices, one Author was able to study their behaviors and actually correlate similarities to that of a hive of Bees…Bees you say?  Yes, Bees! This research is fascinating at the least and provides an endless array of empirical data which may be used in daily life and especially within social groupings, to increase collective intelligence and the effectiveness of the group. 

To back up the science found in Social Physics, the second chapter focuses not on the typical aspects of Big Data; however, specifically upon on how the actual data affects human attitudes towards change, and specifically, the furtherance of knowledge in social groupings. The key take-away from Eagle, N., & Greene, K. (2014)
and their writing, Reality mining: Using big data to engineer a better world, is that although Big Data is a burgeoning and albeit prosperous approach to science and applied research combined, the sources of the data retrieved (consumer habits, etc.) not only feeds the research; however it hinders the research as well, wherein I would assume is the wishy-washy-ness of consumer habits, specifically those of social groups or groupings of groups that may skew or alter outcomes of any such study. Needless to say, the remaining chapters of both these works, deserve a look through, for anyone interested in human behavior and how it relates to private and public groups or organizations. The Facebook references alone, are quite intriguing.



## Chapter Summaries
How Patterns of Interaction Translate into Collective Intelligence (Philip Schotter)

Pentland states that a major influence in predicting group intelligence was the equality of conversational turn taking.  Teams where few members dominate the narrative were less collectively intelligent that those teams with greater team interactive discussion.  Additionally, by analyzing patterns of team interaction and idea flow, research suggests that the best way to improve team performance is to encourage a pattern of engagement and exploration or discovery of new ideas.  In this context, engagement is defined as idea flow between a work group or team.

Alex Pentland and various graduate students created an innovative way to measure how teams are managed with sociometric badges.  The team of students turned colleagues, spun-off a company Sociometric Solutions, that became Humanyze https://www.humanyze.com.  Humanyze are pioneers of organizational analytics.  According to their website, they help organizations understand how their teams interact in order to increase performance.

### Discussion Questions

1. Do you feel that Big Data is here to stay, or in the alternative, here to stay; however, morphed into a more streamlined,    consumer specific and useable for non-invasive group tracking and research?

2.What are your fears about others having/viewing/using your data for research or anticipatory functions related to your specific groups, choices or desires?

3.Would you be willing to be watched or listened to at work in order to improve performance?

4.How would you react if your supervisor gave you feedback that you were dominating your team and not allowing enough interactions and diversity from the other team members?
