## Topic Overview
We live in a culture that is driven by data. Over the past few decades the amount of information that has become available to us has skyrocketed. Technological advances have made it easier to provide data right in the palm of our hands. Technology such as software, smartphones, websites, digital maps and apps to manage our schedules. “Data can be transformative” (p.241) if those using the data know how to properly utilize it. It can be a powerful tool, but only if harness correctly.

One thing that hasn’t changed is that “our ability to learn from information hasn’t necessarily kept pace with its proliferation” (p. 243). In other words, we can accurately measure how much calories we consume in a day but how much does your cholesterol scores improve every week, month or year? We can improve our lives by making our days more productive, eating healthier, making education much more effective and our lives less stressful if we learn to harness these powerful tools.

What we currently suffer from is data overload, so much information makes it difficult to make decisions. This inability to make the best of the data we receive as it becomes more and more readily available is often referred to as “Information Blindness.” Each person’s minds will eventually reach a breaking point and when this occurs people start to ignore options, make bad choices or stop interacting with the information altogether.

We as humans can do a great job of absorbing information, if we break down the data into smaller meaningful pieces. When we do this, it is referred to as “Winnowing,” or “Scaffolding.” This process is the ability to break things down like you would a file cabinet and organize everything into folders and subfolders alphabetically, numerically or whichever method makes things easier to process. According to Eric Johnson a cognitive psychologist from Columbia University who studies decision making, “Our brains crave reducing things to two or three options” (p. 245).


## Chapter Summaries

### Absorbing Data
This chapter investigates how we absorb data and then transform this data into something useful. It discusses the South Avondale school district as being in an Academic Emergency due to dysfunction, crime, and poor academic scores. This is a community that has been in poverty for decades and this school district had to figure out way to changes things for the betterment of its community. One thing that isn’t an issue though is resources, the city spends 3 times as much per student at South Avondale versus other local school districts. Procter & Gamble invested funds in a computer lab, tutoring center and sports programs.

South Avondale put resources into sophisticated software to monitor each student’s performance. They have a website for every student that has a wealth of knowledge, such as test scores, attendance, homework, and classroom participation. However, six years after this was all created teachers started to admit that they didn’t really look at this wealth of data they had or the memos that they received each week and students continued to fail to meet educational standards. It wasn’t until they implemented the Elementary Initiative (EI) when things finally start making a turn for the better.

When the Elementary Initiative was implemented it forced the teachers to work with the data, then and only then did it impact the way they behaved. They learned by hand how to transform spreadsheets, statistics and online dashboards into meaningful plans. Teachers moved from passively absorbing the data to engaging it. Three years later South Avondale test scores went up so much that the White House hailed EI as model of inner-city reform.
