# Topic Overview of Chapter 13: Ethics of Algorithms



## Chapter Summaries

## *Weapons of Math Destruction*, Chapter 9 Summary 

Covered in Chapter 9 is the process of being insured. O’Neil (2016) explores the algorithms behind auto and health insurance.
Her findings show that there are implicit bias within the calculations that determine how a driver or individual is insured
both in auto and health insurance, respectively. These biases often disadvantage minority and poor populations. For example, 
driver with an excellent driving record who has a low credit score would likely have a more expensive auto insurance rate.
Comparatively, it was found that a driver with a DUI on their record who has a high credit score would have a cheaper auto
insurance rate. 

O’Neil (2016) also covers employer wellness programs that are often created as a part of employee health insurance. Many
employer wellness programs, in an effort to lower rates and encourage employee healthy behaviors, have employees share health
data. This data can then be used to show to health insurance companies that employers are making the effort to try to
encourage employees to lose weight, etc. O’Neil cautions that if employers take the next step and create their own health and
productivity models the result could be a serious WMD.
