CH2 the rise of big crisis data- James
There are many types of data and uses for them. As we as a world evolve and become more aware of what data can offer us the first question that we have to ask ourselves is what truly is the quality of the data and is it helping. In this chapter they take a deeper look into how data is actually used in the big picutre.

Starting way back in 1937, when London launched the very first emergency number they recieved 1336 calls the first week, out of that 1073 were real emergiences, 171 just wanted to speak to the operator and 91 calls were jokes or fake calls. That breaks down to about 10% of calls during that first week to be fraudulent in nature. Continuing on this trend the UK shows that less than 25% which equals about 5 million fake calls a year. In New York 911 operators recieve around 10,000 fake calls A DAY. I wanted to highlight these points because with our technology and moving into using communication tools such as social media and hashtags, these are more ways to communicate yes, but these are also more ways to see the infiltration of fake data. 

Overviewing what I took away from this is that despite all of the fake data and trickory that is out there, the use of data and the quality of it still shows to be effective, organizations are still using these methods to save lives, still using technolgy no matter how convoluded as a mechanism for communication. Studies will show both sides of Big Data and many may see an overwhelming side of negativity, but social media is very strong and still young in how its used, but overall shows its effectiveness day in and day out. This chapter brings up a lot of important questions about how social media and data are used, in what kind of specifics are they used and how this data can shed light on how we as a world respond to our needs.
