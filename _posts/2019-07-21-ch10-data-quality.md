Collateral Damage

Before the invention of the FICO score, consumers relied entirely on Bankers to approve or deny credit requests, often based on personal characteristics and activity rather than one’s ability to repay a loan.  Earl Isaac and Bill Fair created a model, the FICO model, which would evaluate an individual’s risk of defaulting on a loan based solely on his/her finances.  In addition to the FICO scoring system still used today, statistical data such as web browsing habits and purchasing patterns, is pulled together to provide insight on customers’ creditworthiness; and an e-score is generated. The problem with e-scores is that they are arbitrary, unregulated, and unfair.  O’neil refers to them as the perfect WMDs. As companies are legally prohibited from using credit scores for marketing purposes, e-scores are used instead.

Many employers use credit scores in their determination of employment. A high credit score may indicate a person is more trustworthy and reliable, leading to more job opportunities.  Using this model for employment determination can also have a negative effect on a person.  If his/her credit score is low, he/she may be passed over for jobs. Without employment and income, he/she may be unable to pay bills, potentially leading to an even greater credit score drop.  

Further concern with automated systems is the lack of human review; errors on credit reports aren’t considered or even noticed.  Consumer profiles are sold to data brokers who profile people from different data sources, there is bound to be inaccuracies.  Customers can be incorrectly profiled and have incorrect information in their files and can miss out of loans, jobs, housing, etc. due to the automation of the process. 

While O’neil does not suggest we go back to the way banking was handled prior to the use of algorithms, she does recognize how e-scores are contaminating financing opportunities for those with lower credit scores.
