This chapter used Meier’s personal experience with what is now known as “digital humanitarianism” during the aftermath 2010 Haitian earthquake to illustrate the potential power of lay-person access to data to save lives. In summary:
* Meier’s wife was in Port-Au-Prince when the earthquake hit. Out of desperation to contact his wife (and a desire to do something), he set up a “crisis map” of Haiti using information he found from tweets online and from the Open Street Map (in his words, the “Wikipedia of maps”) (2015, p. 2-4). 
* To more fully flesh out the map, he created a multiplatform account which could receive incoming email, tweets and SMS texts about the disaster.
* He soon recruited others around him - and, ultimately, throughout the world - to help sift through the data and update important information about aftermath details in Haiti from his dorm room in Boston, MA. 
* FEMA and other branches of the US government used the information crowd-sourced from Meier’s volunteers to coordinate on-the-ground care immediately after the earthquake.

Meier argues that this experience highlights the promise of big data (i.e. it can literally save lives) and some of the complications (i.e. balancing personal privacy with collected data, what to use it for [i.e. should they stop their work once triage for the event was completed or continue on to show accountability for relief efforts?], etc.). He ended with a preview of remaining chapters in the book, which would explore other topics such as Big (False) data, policies and technology, AI, and more.
