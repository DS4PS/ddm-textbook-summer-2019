### Digital Humanitarians **CH1 Rise of Digital Humanitarianism**
This chapter used Meier’s personal experience with what is now known as “digital humanitarianism” during the aftermath 2010 Haitian earthquake to illustrate the potential power of lay-person access to data to save lives. In summary:
* Meier’s wife was in Port-Au-Prince when the earthquake hit. Out of desperation to contact his wife (and a desire to do something), he set up a “crisis map” of Haiti using information he found from tweets online and from the Open Street Map (in his words, the “Wikipedia of maps”) (2015, p. 2-4). 
* To more fully flesh out the map, he created a multiplatform account which could receive incoming email, tweets and SMS texts about the disaster.
* He soon recruited others around him - and, ultimately, throughout the world - to help sift through the data and update important information about aftermath details in Haiti from his dorm room in Boston, MA. 
* FEMA and other branches of the US government used the information crowd-sourced from Meier’s volunteers to coordinate on-the-ground care immediately after the earthquake.

Meier argues that this experience highlights the promise of big data (i.e. it can literally save lives) and some of the complications (i.e. balancing personal privacy with collected data, what to use it for [i.e. should they stop their work once triage for the event was completed or continue on to show accountability for relief efforts?], etc.). He ended with a preview of remaining chapters in the book, which would explore other topics such as Big (False) data, policies and technology, AI, and more.


### NYT **The Age of Big Data**
This article is about the explosion of available data in recent years, its applications across fields, and how to harness it. The impact of Big Data will extend far beyond the tech companies of Silicon Valley; there are implications for business, government, and academia. According to the article, “There is no area that is going to be untouched” (qtd. in Lohr 2012). The surge in available data has also created a rapidly growing need for workers with data expertise. 

The author defines Big Data as “...advancing trends in technology that open the door to a new approach to understanding the world and making decisions” (Lohr 2012). Large quantities of data are rapidly becoming more available and understandable. Most of Big Data exists as “unstructured data.” However, we are developing new tools, like AI, to gain insight from unstructured data. 

The article compares the impact of Big Data to that of the microscope in the 16th century. We are able to measure behavior and sentiment in fine detail in real time using data from platforms like Google and social media sites.

In business, decision making is becoming more analytical, and it’s paying off. Research shows that data-driven decision making increases productivity. Using Big Data to make predictions also has implications for preventing (or minimizing) public health disasters and economic downturns. 

There are risks associated with Big Data. Privacy is at the top of the list, of course. Other potential pitfalls include an increased risk of false discoveries, biased fact-finding, and unfair or discriminatory statistical inferences. However, the author concludes that, “Despite the caveats, there seems to be no turning back. Data is in the driver’s seat. It’s there, it’s useful and it’s valuable, even hip” (Lohr 2012).
