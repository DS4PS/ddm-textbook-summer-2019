title: "Prediction (Playing Moneyball)"

Team 4: Martha Ramos, Philip Schlotter, Randolph Wilkins


## Topic Overview (Randy Wilkins)


As in earlier chapters, Eagle and Greene continue the dynamic discussion related to Big Data and how it’s use of data can be used to predict future or even anticipated events similarly to how a Psychic or Medium would utilize a “crystal ball.”  Once you recover from the analogy chuckle, seriousness sets in, as Eagle and Greene focus upon how that “crystal ball” or their reference, “money ball,” may solve for large scale disease issues, community health concerns, transportation problems and best of all, deter crime.
Given that data analytics may sometimes emphasize or “push” an agenda, such as operational efficiencies, all the while, sacrificing a complete, idealization of what the data implies, these analytical models if you will, might be enhanced through the use of AI (artificial intelligence) to introduce a humanistic level of analysis to better correlate the data to its particular use or specific need. Eagle and Greene, although supportive of the use of data for the better good, they do caution that we as a society should not rely singularly on Big Data, and hint that some type of confirmation or substance validity be tacked on to correlate the calculations of the data, to the everyday lives of the intended beneficiaries. 
Widespread use of the data collected by Big Data has long posed questions about reliability, bias, criminal miss-use, and the efficacy of the data itself. Even though the data was collected to provide a better understanding of societies needs and issues etc.,  the Big Data collections were designed to eliminate issues that had presented in the past, yet, no one collector has considered human intellect, human rational, human feelings, etc., and their respective effect upon the collection data, therefore, the usage of the collected data continues to pose the same question as before: Has the loss of data control really helped society or has it carried on earlier bias and is therefore skewed and not useable?


## Chapter Summaries


Chapter 10: Engineering a Safer and Healthier World (Philip Schlotter)

Eagle and Greene discuss that with the proliferation of data and the increasing availability of data, it may be possible to engineer a safer and healthier world but learning how to track and update the movement of people.  The research is not looking at ambulation of individuals but instead the movement of a heard.  By understanding first that disease travels in or on people and other vectors like insects may travel on or in airlines, cargo ships or trains, we can follow the reports of illness around the world through various trade and travel routes.

It is suggested that by tracking mobile phone call detail records (CDR) it may be possible to more quickly identify an outbreak and predict the path of the carriers.  Additionally, when a concern is identified, public health officials may be able to deploy real-time surveys to mobile phone subscribers in that area to acquire near instantaneous data and use that to trend and predict disease progress.

While that data collection method would require that people acknowledge to and submit data back, the fascination with posting nearly every even online for the world to see may allow for a better way.  By following and analyzing Twitter and Facebook posts, could it be possible to use all that free and freely given data to track real-time outbreaks?

Data is collected from each of us hundreds of times each day from what we search on-line to where we purchase our groceries to what kind of ketchup we prefer.  Will the evolution of big data help us to improve our health or simply allow us to coordinate our travel to healthier locations?

Discussion Questions

1.	Would you look at data when planning a trip?
2.	Would you change your destination if you found that a flu outbreak was present at the time you wanted to visit?
3.	Would you travel on a particular bridge if you knew the probabilities of its failure?
4.	Would you chose to take a medication if the efficacy was in question?
