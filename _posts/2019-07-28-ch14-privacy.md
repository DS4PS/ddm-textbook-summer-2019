Privacy. What Will a Data-Rich Future Look Like?(Philip Schlotter)

Pentland’s chapter about privacy discusses potential problems with a data-rich future.  Now that we are generating more and more data every day, who will be the keepers of the data? How will that data be used?  Can the private sector be trusted with big data? Can the government be trusted with big data?

Pentland professes that there should be a new process for managing data and he and his team are working on creating that “New Deal on Data” (Pentland, 2015).  Pentland lays out a process of data ownership, similar to owning real property, where the data owners will have the right to possess, the right of full control of use and the right to dispose of or distribute that data.  The data keepers will be responsible for holding and managing your data, similar to how a bank or credit union holds your financial instruments.  If the consumer is unhappy with how their data is being managed, they may have the option to remove their data from that data keeper and place it with another.  In theory, data keepers will maintain or grow their business by keeping their customer satisfaction scores above a minimum level.

Pentland also discusses the challenges of a data-rich system.  Because the data points grow exponentially, conventional analysis tools are not sufficient to cope with seemingly infinite variables.  Pentland is working on a map tool similar to Google Maps but instead of locations and traffic, the new map will track poverty, crime rates, and other social indicators.

Pentland states that one of his goals is “…to develop new ways of sharing data to promote greater civic engagement and exploration.”( (Pentland, 2015)  The collected data can be utilized for self-improvement or once grouped for improvement of a community.

Personal data have been called the oil of the new economy. (Pentland, 2015)  This personal data that we give away for the use of the most common applications is what allows smart phones and other services to personalize our experience.  Did you search for a new mattress on your electronic device and then a few days later, an advertisement is in your news feed on your computer.  Coincidence? No.  As an incentive to use that cool new application on your phone for “free”, you allowed the application to learn a few things about you.  You may be ok with getting some advertising for new mattresses or new clothing but what happens when you search for medical terms?  What if you have a serious disease that you are scared about?  Would you still want a treatment or medication to be presented to you based on you search history and the manufacture’s purchase of that data?

Pentland recommends allowing an Open PDS (personal data store) that will anonymize your data but still allow researchers or retailers to use it as a group but without the ability to track the personal data back to the person.  I had to think about this for a bit to get a better understanding of what Pentland was describing.  I am thinking of this process similar to Apple Pay.  I can make a purchase with my credit card and have the potential for a person to capture my credit card number and possibly use the data for another purpose or sell the data.  Enter Apple Pay.  Now, I can waive my phone near the credit card terminal and Apply Pay removed my real credit card number from the transaction and replaces it with another identifier for that transaction only.  If a hacker captured that data, he or she could not use of sell that data to anyone because it would not work again.  That anonymizing process is similar to how Pentland explains his Open PDS.  In Appendix 2, OPEN PDS, Pentland does mention that the possibility reidentification or deanonymization of mobility data sets using only four spatiotemporal points.  That one section makes me think about the security of the entire process.  I think more work is needed.






## Discussion Questions (for Yellowdig)

1. Would you have faith that private sector or government sector would gather your data and use it for a noble purpose?
2. Would you want to be compensated for the use of your private data by private sector organizations?  
3. Would you be more willing to give your data to the government for free if it was for the betterment of the community?
