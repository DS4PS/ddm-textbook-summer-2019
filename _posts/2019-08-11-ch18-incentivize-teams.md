Chapter 3: Idea Flow Summary
Pentland (2015) feels that the rates of idea flow or barriers to idea flow will make or break an organization and set its culture (p. 44). This idea, building off of other chapters, reconfirms the notion that more minds are better than one; that sharing ideas and information will create better solutions and societal norms. Through various research cases related to health habits, political preferences, and consumer consumption, Pentland (2015) believes idea flow can be predicted by direct and indirect exposure to peer behavior (p. 53). Such idea flow leads to efficiencies by learning from others as opposed to starting from scratch. Idea flow also leads to our ability to use “fast thinking” may account for about 90% of most daily decisions, while “slow thinking”—experimentation, critical thinking, and reaching our own conclusions—is only used for about 10% of decision-making (Petland, 2015, p. 54-56). In conclusion, “[i]t is the idea flow within a community that builds the intelligence that makes it successful” (Pentland, 2015, p. 61).
